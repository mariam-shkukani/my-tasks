### What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
I learned how to plan and structure a web project from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Drawing the wireframe really helped me visualize the layout before coding. One question I still have is how to improve the interactivity of the task list.

### How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?
I expected it to take about 2 hours, but it took me around 3 hours because I spent time designing and fixing layout issues.
